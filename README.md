# Project Meeting 0 
- Discuss the overall design of fuzzer (slides/hand-drawn/word)
- Highlight which parts of the fuzzer we plan to implement ourselves 
- Discuss set of tools we plan to use out-of-the-box 
- Discuss which parts of the designs are generic, and which parts need to be configured/tuned based on the two case studies 
- Discuss the use cases for the fuzzer, i.e. how would someone use our fuzzer beyond the case studies 

1. What are the test inputs? 
2. Which file(s) do you use to start writing your fuzzer/ which file(s) show a demo test case? 
3. How do you get code coverage for Django application? 
4. How do you detect crashes and logical bugs? 
5. What feedbacks to collect from test execution to improve fuzzer/which tests are interesting? 
6. How to improve the fuzzer to find more bugs efficiently?
