## 1. Introduction
- **Software Testing Project** using python
- Brief high-level overview of the two fuzz targets  

## 2. Purpose & Security Testing Approach
- Project goals (detecting crashes, undefined behavior, coverage improvements)  
- Why AFL fuzzing (advantages in genetic mutation, instrumentation)  
- Scope: BLE vs. Django targets  

## 3. Architecture

```
- **`run.sh`**  
  Acts as the project’s bootstrapper. When invoked, it:  
  1. Ensures you’re in the repository root.  
  2. Creates (if needed) and activates a Python 3 virtual environment in `.local`.  
  3. Installs or updates all dependencies from `requirements.txt`.  
  4. Hands control to `main.py` via `exec`, preserving the activated environment context.

- **`main.py`**  
  Serves as the interactive entrypoint to the AFL fuzzing harness. On launch it:  
  1. Loads environment variables from `.env` (e.g. Django folder names).  
  2. Configures colored CLI output and logging.  
  3. Displays supported targets and prompts for a command.  
  4. Validates the command, verifies any prerequisites (e.g. Django project structure), and then invokes the `simple_fuzzer2` harness (`fuzz_main()`) with or without a specific file argument.

### 3.2 BLE Application Fuzzing
- How AFL integrates with BLE binary  
- Instrumentation or harness details  
- Input formats and mutation strategy  

### 3.3 Django Application Fuzzing
- Web-app harness (HTTP endpoints, input sanitization)  
- AFL’s server-side instrumentation (e.g., compile flags)  
- Handling stateful targets (database snapshots, rollbacks)  

## 4. Installation & Setup
- **Prerequisites:** Python, AFL, BLE toolchain, Django dependencies  
- **Cloning & Environment:**  
  ```bash
  git clone …
  cd afl-power
  ./run.sh



Here’s a professional, visually-focused **README.md** outline in Markdown. You can later fill in each section with the detailed content.
